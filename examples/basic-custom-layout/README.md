# Basic Custom Layout Example

This example shows how to create a simple custom layout to show content in the chat widget. In the example we'll override a built in layout (the `choose` layout ) so that we display a dropdown instead of buttons which is the default behavior.

## Installing and Running Locally
From inside the `examples/basic-custom-layout` folder run:

  1. `npm install`
  2. `npm start`
  3.  open `http://localhost:3100` in browser

## Additional Documentation
Please see [registering a custom layout documentation](https://github.com/watson-virtual-agents/chat-widget/blob/master/docs/DOCS.md#registering-a-custom-layout) for additional information.
